Employee attrition happens when an employee leaves an organization for any reason and is not replaced for a long time, or not ever. 
It often results in a decrease in the size of an organization’s or department’s workforce because positions aren’t refilled when employees leave.
The main objective in addressing employee attrition is to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company.
By understanding the factors influencing attrition rates, organizations can take preventive actions and retain valuable employees.
